What is the difference between commit and push?
- A commit records changes made to the project in the local repository. It serves as a snapshot of the current state of the code at a specific point in time. A push, on the other hand, uploads these committed changes from the local repository to a remote repository, making them accessible to other collaborators.
  
Why are branches important?
- Branches are important because they allow developers to work on new features, fixes, or experiments independently from the main codebase. This prevents disruptions to the stable version of the project and supports parallel development. Branches also make collaboration more efficient and organized.
  
What causes merge conflicts?
- Merge conflicts occur when multiple changes are made to the same part of a file and Git is unable to automatically determine which version should be applied. This usually happens when different contributors modify the same lines of code separately. Resolving merge conflicts requires manual review and selection of the appropriate changes.
